# Essential TypeScript

A simple to-do list application.

>The application will display a list of tasks, allow new tasks to be created, and allow existing tasks to be marked as complete.
There will also be a filter to include already completed tasks in the list.
Once the core features are in place, I will add support for storing data persistently so that changes are not lost when the application is terminated.
