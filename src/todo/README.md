# Essential TypeScript

A simple to-do list console application written in TypeScript inspired by the book 'Essential TypeScript Third Edition' by Adam Freeman.

The application will display a list of tasks, allow new tasks to be created, and allow existing tasks to be marked as complete.
There will also be a filter to include already completed tasks in the list.
Includes support for storing data persistently so that changes are not lost when the application is terminated.
